Emma is playing a new mobile game involving `n` clouds numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. A player initially starts out on cloud `C0`, and they must jump to cloud `Cn-1`. In each step, she can jump from any cloud `i` to cloud `i + 1` or cloud `i + 2`.

There are two types of clouds, ordinary clouds and thunderclouds. The game ends if Emma jumps onto a thundercloud, but if she reaches the last cloud (i.e., `Cn-1`), she wins the game!
